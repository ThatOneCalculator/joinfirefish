# Guidelines for submitting a Firefish server

- Active moderation against hate, discrimination, spam, harrassment, illegal content, etc, including but not limited to defederating with other instances that allow such behavior and content
- Consistent backups in case of an emergency
- Signups are enabled and will remain enabled unless there's an emergency
- In case of a permanent shutdown, users will be notified at least one month in advance
- Hosted on a solution that allows at least 100 users
- Updates Firefish on at least the stable channel no later than one month after a release is published
- Does NOT run in private mode
- Will not switch to Misskey or a non-Firefish based fork of Misskey. Soft forks (follow upstream) of Firefish are fine, but hard forks (don't follow upstream) are not.
- Has a description, terms of service, and admin contact info (bonus points for an icon and background!)
- (At least one) administrator that is 17 years or older
- Allows the `FirefishOrg/0.1.0; +https://joinfirefish.org/join` UserAgent to query Nodeinfo and stats (used for the website)

Breaking any of these guidelines will get your server delisted immediately. These guidelines are subject to change at any time.
