title: Firefish's ActivityPub extensions
---

These are the extensions to ActivityPub that Firefish implements. This page uses [compact IRIs](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#dfn-compact-iri). The `firefish` prefix is used to refer to `https://joinfirefish.org/ns#`.

## speakAsCat

- Compact IRI: `firefish:speakAsCat`
- Canonical IRI: `https://joinfirefish.org/ns#speakascat`

Used on actors to indicate that they not only identify as a cat, but also want to have their text be transformed to speak like one, expressed as a boolean value. If this property is set to true, displaying the actor's posts will make them speak with "nya" instead of "na" and other cat-related text mannerisms. Used in combination with [`misskey:isCat`](https://misskey-hub.net/ns.html#iscat).
